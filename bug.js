This error typically occurs when you try to import a module that doesn't exist or is not correctly configured in your Expo project.  It's especially common when using third-party libraries or custom components. The exact error message might vary slightly depending on the library or component causing the problem.  For example, you might see 'Cannot find module 'react-native-maps' or a similar message.
